# The Old Man With With One Hanging Eyeball 

The old man sitting down in park.

He chose a bench in the sun, but he didn’t know there was a nest of crows nearby, and it was that time in springtime where the motherbird feels threatend by the invader. She attacks the old man in the left eye and the man sees with his right eye how the left eye is hanging out and the Only thing he can think of is he forgot to do the dishes this morning.

The old man with hanging eye made a phone call to his wife, and she tell him it was not a problem. She would wash them in the evening. But another scary feeling break in his mind...

...what if my wife will never reach the house that night, because she gets seduced by a man with a beard until his knees? He tought.

Meanwhile old man starts feeling confused, also by the rainbow that suddenly appears and two horse riders passing by and 30 frogs who start choral singing.

The day after, the old man with hanging eyeball wake up, made breakfast, but while he was slicing onions, he was distracted, and once he reach the fingers, he keep slicing till his left wrist. He though that would be a waste of meat if he would trash it, so he cooked everything and had his meal.

He felt a little bit of a stomache, but he went to the swimmingpool anyway. And when he jumped into the water the whole world around him became black and white.

Cool he though...dressing code will be a lot more easier right now! So he went in a dress shop, he had new whole suit. Then he went in a restaurant and he had some fun noticing how food-dirty spot was quite invisible in black&white.

He noticed the man in the corner of the restaurant eating a lobster. The man looked like a runner. And he discovered he was not longer wearing a smoking, but a building, with his arms streched out the windows.

People paniking at the windows, smoke and fire, like any other building eradicated from foundation from a giant old man with hanging eyeball.

Time to go home to bed he thought. And he dragged his concrete construction in fire to the next block. The burning building walked into another building and took the elevator to the seventh floor. He opened all his windows to search for his keys. He found out the door was already open and he felt very relieved he was home.

Goodnight! He said to his wife. I’m very tired, but i Will tell you all about it tomorrow...

But the day after, when he awoke, the wife was missing and a guy...rude, muscled man, was sitting in the middle of the room. Naked. Covered only by an extremly thick beard. Keeping a big cigar under thick yellowish moustache. A glass of some disgusting barbon-like in left hand.
Who are you? Told the man with one hanging eyeball. And what the fuck are you doing there, naked?

It’s hot in here said the beardguy. You were burning as hell, didn’t you notice? I saved you here. I put out the fire with orange juice. You are very lucky I was here!

Ok, said the old man with one hanging eyeball full of joice, that's probably reply to the question "why am I so stincky?", too...
...the old man looked back to beard-guy, but anybody was left...just a glass of bourbon and a sigar sitting on the chair...in black&white...flooting over the sun.

Where is my floor? The old man though...

The bourbon started going up out of the glass like a fountain. The smoke of the cigar flowed like a waterfall through the floor that disappeared, it kept on falling into a dark whole. He was standing in the edge. The old man then looked up and saw his floor. “Oh there you are!” He said relieved.

...I thought I lost the ground under my feet, said the old man to the floor. ‘But you are just on vacation’. Enjoy your trip! I will wait for you to come back. Meanwhile I will crawl on my knees on the edge of this strange Rocky whole full of emptiness and smoke...”and voices with desires!” called out the black hole.

"WTF, man? I always been hire, exactly where I am, right now!"
"Wow...my floor speek in a curios american accent...where did it learnt?" he thought to himself. "You are sticky to the ceiling. How can I go around if you stay there?" reply the old man to the floor sticked to the ceiling.
"Bro, you can go wherever you want. It's not my business" the floor riplied to old man. Soon phone started ringing and the old man became angry. "Flooooooooorrr. I need my phone! Go down!". "Jump up to me, looser!" reply the floor. "Floooooooooor. My phone!!!...

Unfortunately the person you have called could not be reached, please leave a message after the beep. BEEEEPPP!

"Hello sir, Holy Mary Church? I'm looking for a place for a baptismo. I know it's a little bit strange, but...theme are 8 holy creatures, gone out from a single women. She's dead now. But childs still need baptismo, right? Please, call me back ASAP. God bless you, sir". Tootootoo...

The old man suddenly remembered he had telepathical gifts and he didn’t need his telephone at all. Eight holy creatures? then we have to go the purple river! Quick! Best spot is by the weeping willow with large branches floating on the stream of the river.
23/02/23, 00:04 - Sofie: I mean you are open, but you seem always to know already how all things work, so I don’t know how I can help you. I cannot even give you a comforting hug for your sadness towards your dog...

"What a hell!" shouted old man seeing the river. Is that...pee? The old man went closer to the riverside, and took a look at the river. Was not pee...infact, it was...gold! All the water left space to shiny small metal gold coins, that was rattling and glittering all over the valley.

We are at the wrong river! This river is so tricky, nobody dears to take a piece of it. Even when you get closer, the shiny parts reflect so much you become blind after seeing yourself a million times and it Will be the only thing that’s burned on your retina. And in the beginning it seems you can live with it, but after a while you get really sick of seeing yourself and the only thing that helps is a spoon of tears of a blue whale...how did we get here?! The purple river must have changed course! Luckily the old man had a device to locate the source of all purple matter... but he Will not be able to reach it by foot on time. And meanwhile he was thinking how to get there he was stung by a mosquito.

Slaaaaap!! This is the sound a mosquito do when it dies.
The old man takes a look at the bite, searching the mosquito.
WTF, man! One poor guy can't even takes a seat, drinks some blood, eats some meat...without getting slapped from a stranger? What do you have in your mind?
...the mosquito says
You was biting me and lieterally drinking me. I was just protecting myself
...the old man reply
...meanwhile...a giant hand, appears in the sky. And I mean a really giantgiantgiant hand! Stand, fixed, flying in the sky.
Revange time!
...the mosquito, shout
Go to hell!
...the old man reply...

The Giant hand came closer and closer and went just through the mosquito ande old man and passed with a lot of wind back in the sky. Oh, it’s the grabbing hand that is never really able to grasp anything. What a feeling said the old man to the mosquito...never able to really touch anything...sigh...

The old man starts empathize with the giant hand, then he cried and fall asleep, shattered.
The day after a shining sun is walking around the sky. The old man could see the sun behinde the giant fingers.
This is the day you're going to grab something, I promise, the old man said to himself. I don't know how...yet...but it's going to be today! He's repeted to himself.

Mhmmm...I'm not really trusting you. But I going to give you a chance, just in case. Told the old man to the mosquito.
But how can I interact with a hand? Asked the old man to the mosquito.
The hands is one of the most ductile tools in human body. I think you can use whatever you want. Reply the mosquito.
Whatever I can, lets say. Shout the old man to the mosquito, a little annoyed, and he started thinking how to do that.

The old man suddenly had an idea and he sneaked to the Giant hand (there was strange enough an elevator going very close to the Giant hand. It was a bit scary to take it, because it was wiggling in the air and really steep. When he was close enough, he started tickling the hand. First nothing happened, but then the fingers started moving hesitating and curled up in the palm. Not much later the hand laughed hard and started shaking. With each shake the fingernails were growing longer. The hand spread his fingers again and felt all this tinglings, he turned his hand trying to watch himself, but he didn’t have eyes, so he didn’t see anything. 
The old man crawled carefully on the hand, and he didn’t fall through. Oof. He then Drawed a map in the palm of the hand with directions to the purple river. The hand laughed and Shaked in the direction of the purple river...
The team finnally arrived at purple river. The small fat mosquito. The old man with one handling eyeball. And the giant flying hand.
Funny fact: you can see only 2 of them in one frame, due to size difference.
It's not so purple, said the mosquito. Shut up, said the old man. You can't see purple color, continued the old man.
What's color? Said the hand...

While the man was arguing about purple with the mosquito and color with the hand, a bunch of very little human was crawling around the purple river. 
What the fuck is that? Asked the mosquito pointing a curios hole, that was becoming bigger in the muddle of the purple river.
That's a black hole of Jesus, reply the old man. Let's go there, the kids need us. The team start walking in the hole direction

The old man walked towards the hole and after tree steps his body was completed taken over by the force of the hole. the hole sucked up the man instantly. He grabbed the edge of the hole for a few seconds and saw multiple echo’s of himself hanging on the edge. (The edge  was a kind of frozen wave). The echo’s were upside down and transparant. Then the edge/wave crumbled into pieces and the man got squeezed and stretched out like a chewing gum, and then got catapulted deep into the hole.

The man stepped out of the hole into this other world and he remarkably is still alive. He looks at himself and he has a completely different shape. He tries to examines himself but he seems completely attached to his surroundings. Each time he tries to move something from his new body, his whole vision changes shapes also...

...in this world, imagination is the actual thing, and moving is more like thinking about things.
The old man, looked around him, trying to not move at all, but it's impossible. So the everything around him and himself was constantly changing shape and colour in a complete rainbow mess.
The old man was slowly understanding and accepting the new reality, even because he was unable to relocate hole to come back.
The old man close his eyes...well, the good one at least...and start imagining, maybe, for the first time in his whole life.

...he felt a peace upon his forehead and the rainbow inktspots were withdrawing under his eyelid. He experienced a flash back from him, standing in the garden covered by lots of snow. He was staring at the white snow that hided his playground under a large crispy soft carpet. The sun shined harsh and the bright white generated black blind spots in his field of view. They danced everywhere he looked. Meanwhile a crow was cawing very loud. And the crispy soft carpet sucked up all the sound and hided it together with the playground under the white floor...the inktspots were gone now and the memory melted until the old man saw his weathered hands holding a tangled cord. On the cord were marks and he realized he was holding his own timeline with here and there loose ends and he immediatly felt the urge to untangle the line, but the knots were too tight...
